## üîß Technical Details

### Payment Verification First
- Notifications are sent ONLY after Pesapal confirms payment success
- Prevents sending notifications for failed/cancelled payments
- Located in `callback` method, not `checkout` method
- Checks for status: `COMPLETED` or `PAID`

```javascript
// Only send if payment successful
if (upperStatus === 'COMPLETED' || upperStatus === 'PAID') {
  logger.info('Payment successful - sending WhatsApp notifications');
  this.sendOrderNotifications(fullOrder, items, customer, sellerId).catch(err => {
    logger.error('Error sending WhatsApp notifications after payment:', err);
  });
}
```

### Non-Blocking
All notifications are sent asynchronously and won't block the order process:
```javascript
sendOrderStatusNotifications(order, updatedOrder, status).catch(err => {
  console.error('Error sending WhatsApp notifications:', err);
});
```

### Graceful Failure
- If WhatsApp service is down, orders still process normally
- Errors are logged but don't affect user experience
- Phone number validation happens before sending

### Automatic Retry
- WhatsApp service has built-in retry logic
- Session management for persistent connection
- QR code regeneration on disconnection

## üìù Notes

1. **4 main notification types** (as per requirements):
   - Order created (after successful payment)
   - Order cancelled (by buyer or seller)
   - Ready for pickup
   - Order completed

2. **Cancellation handling:**
   - Buyer and seller get different messages depending on who cancelled
   - Refund information included in buyer's message
   - Logistics partner always notified to prevent processing

3. **Phone format:** All phone numbers are normalized to handle +254/0 prefixes

4. **Message timestamps:** All messages include local timestamps

5. **Non-blocking:** Notification failures don't prevent order processing

---

## üß™ Testing

To test notifications:

1. **Create an order** ‚Üí Check buyer, seller, and logistics phones
2. **Cancel an order (as buyer)** ‚Üí Check all 3 parties receive cancellation notices
3. **Cancel an order (as seller)** ‚Üí Check all 3 parties receive cancellation notices
4. **Mark as Ready for Pickup** ‚Üí Check pickup details in buyer message
5. **Confirm Receipt** ‚Üí Check thank you and completion messages
